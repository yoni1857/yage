# Yet Another Game Engine (Very original name, I know.)



`Trigger Warning:` 
This project contains code that was not made 
with the general public in mind and was written 
by someone who does not know what they are doing. 
Any code you read may or may not offend you. 
**You have been warned.**

Right now this project only works on Windows 
due to its dependency on `windows.h` and the 
dynamically linked version of SDL2.

Enjoy?
