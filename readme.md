# Yet Another Game Engine
#### Very original name, I know.

```
Trigger Warning: Terrible Code Ahead.

This project has been made by someone who does not know what they are doing. Any code you may read may or may not 
offend you. You have been warned.
``` 


Right now this project only works on Microsoft Windows 
due to its dependency on `windows.h` and the 
dynamically linked version of SDL2.

Enjoy?
